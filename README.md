# Invisible_Cloak

This is an interesting project using the OpenCV library of python. In this project, the background is captured for some time and after that
whenever some red object comes in front of the camera, it detects the same and replaces the area occupied by the red object in the frames
with the background portion which was there before the red object appearance.
The color can be chosen as per user's interest with some small changes in the code.

This uses the concept of Color Detection and Segmentation. For better results over the corners, morphology is used. 
This basic process in such a short code can be used to create really cool magical visual effects like vanishing something using a cloth of color of user's choice. This indeed can be 
compared to the famous Invisible Cloak of Harry Potter.
